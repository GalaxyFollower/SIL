# Overview

The Simulink Interface Layer (SIL) is an extension of the Simulink Coder generation tool which allows it to generate code which is compatible with the cFS ECI (External Code Tool), enabling development of CFS applications within the Simulink environment. The SIL and ECI enables direct integration of code from the Simulink autocoding pipeline into the cFS without the need for application-specific interface code and allows autogenerated code access to cFS API's including table services, time services, the software bus, event services, and fault reporting.
